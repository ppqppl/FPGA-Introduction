Determining the location of the ModelSim executable...

Using: D:\environment\IDE\Quartus_18.1.0.625\modelsim_ase\win32aloem

To specify a ModelSim executable directory, select: Tools -> Options -> EDA Tool Options
Note: if both ModelSim-Altera and ModelSim executables are available, ModelSim-Altera will be used.
